# Http Filtering Engine
Transparent filtering TLS proxy that supports Adblock Plus Filters and CSS Selectors.

Note, this project is heavily under development, and is by no means ready for production, or even testing for that matter. While this project is mostly derrived from a mature project I've had closed source for a few years, I've actually rewritten a large majority of the code as I've published, and as such these changes are untested. This is a temporary note just to warn of this, because I've noticed activity starting to grow, people cloning the repo etc. In a few days, once I've resolved all the bugs I've introduced, this notice will be taken down.
